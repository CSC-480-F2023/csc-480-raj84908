In the GitHub course, I received a comprehensive introduction to the world of version control and collaborative software development. 
I learned about Git, a powerful distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks code changes and makes collaboration seamless.
GitHub, an online platform, was introduced as a user-friendly interface for leveraging the power of Git, facilitating collaboration and maintaining project history. 
The course covered the GitHub Flow, a lightweight workflow for experimentation and collaboration. Key concepts, such as repositories (project folders), 
cloning (creating local copies), committing, and pushing changes to remote repositories were explained. I also became familiar with essential GitHub terms like branches, 
forks, pull requests, and issues. Lastly, the course encouraged me to engage with the vibrant GitHub community through actions like starring repositories, following users, 
and exploring GitHub Explore to discover new projects and developers. This knowledge equips me with the foundational skills needed for effective software development and collaboration 
on the GitHub platform.
